Although it's designed specifically for <a href="http://dsgamemaker.com">DS Game Maker</a> (which generates dsgmLib code files), it's ideal for general Nintendo DS homebrew games as well. </p> <p> In particular, dsgmLib is a successor to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pands/">PAlib</a> and an alternative to <a href="http://www.nightfoxandco.com/?page_id=135">NightFox’s Lib</a>. </p> </div> <div class=quote-reference > <a href="https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmLib/blob/master/README.md">- dsgmLib README.md</a> </div> <br> <br> <h2>Features</h2> <ul> <li>High level object oriented programming <li>Wireless DS to DS multiplayer (NiFi) <li>Saving and loading <li>3D (support for MD2 models with animation and texturing, as well as abstractions for complex 3D maths such as quaternions) <li>Drawable backgrounds <li>Rotatable and scalable backgrounds <li>Custom fonts <li>Scaling and rotating of sprites <li>Sound effects, and music </ul> <br> <h2>Event driven and object-oriented programming</h2> <p> As a C programmer, object oriented programming is not something that I have much experience with; I had to employ some, <i>questionable</i>, techniques in order to make the object system work as I wanted. Because of this, the source code is not representative of my usual, clean, style. </p> <p> With that said, the combination of event driven, and object-oriented code is extremely pleasing; in the right hands, dsgmLib can be used to create some superbly clean code: </p> <pre><code class=language-c >void ball_touch(ballObjectInstance *me) {
	me->x += 32;
	me->y += 32;
}</code></pre> <br> <p> <i>When any instance of <code>ball</code> is touched, it is moved down and right by 32 pixels.</i> </p> <br> <h2>Screenshots of somes examples</h2> <p> The source code for all examples can be found in <a href="https://github.com/DSGameMaker/dsgmLib/">the repository</a>. </p> <div class=center > <img src="images/dsgmLib/quake.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/kart.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/galaxy.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/unpossible.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/tetris.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/fruitNinja.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/worms.png" /> <img src="images/dsgmLib/pokemon.png" /> </div> <br> <br> <h2>Games made by others</h2> <div class=center > <img src="images/dsgmLib/tickTackToe3D.png" /> <p> <a href="https://github.com/PrismaNano/TicTacToe3D">Tick Tack Toe 3D</a> by <a href="https://github.com/PrismaNano">PrismaNano</a> </p> </div> <br> <h2>Feedback</h2> <div class=quote > <p> I just want to say it's great what you guys have been doing! I downloaded the latest build of dsgmLib yesterday expecting un-finished coding with no examples/documentation that'd be super-complicated to figure out (Especially because it's in C which I don't have much experience in when compared to C#.), but I was wrong! You already have several great examples which explain pretty much everything about the library, and actually coding with it is a breeze! </p> <p> ... </p> <p> It just makes DS home-brew creation so easy! No longer do you have to have to code sprite-drawing tasks by yourself, or put up with the many limitations of PALib. dsgmLib handles it all for you, and it does it well! </p> <p> ... </p> <p> while I doubt I understand it well enough to actually code dsgmLib, I definitely understand it well enough to make some examples for the library. Currently I'm porting the 'Asteroids X' example from DSGM 5, and it's going much better than I would've expected thanks to your amazing library! </p> </div> <div class=quote-reference > - <a href="http://dsgamemaker.com/dsgmforum/viewtopic.php?f=31&t=5928&p=81776#p81763">Graham Scott</a> </div> <br> <br> <div class=quote > it's totally awesome you coded this lib! Having PAlib taken out of the picture, using this lib (especially without the app counterpart) gives a sense of "coding freedom" in a way older versions of DSGM withheld from the user. It's much more capable of executing things more efficiently and I find it to be less buggy and more reliable. </div> <div class=quote-reference > - <a href="https://github.com/PrismaNano">PrismaNano</a> </div> <br> <br> </div> </div> <script src="js/prism.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
